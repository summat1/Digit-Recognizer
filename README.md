# Digit-Recognizer
A neural network to recognize handwritten digits made from only base Python libraries and no machine learning toolkits. A great first ML project to understand the fundamentals. The data comes from the MNIST database which contains hand drawn digits and is commonly used for this application, sourced from Kaggle.
