# Digit-Recognizer
A neural network to recognize handwritten digits made from only base Python libraries, no machine learning toolkits. A great first ML project to understand the fundamentals. The data comes from the MNIST database which contains hand drawn digits and is commonly used for this application, sourced from Kaggle.
Note: The test data provided from Kaggle doesn't have labels, so I didn't use it at all here.
